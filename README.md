- 👋 Hi, I’m @Joan-Robles
- 👀 I’m interested in econometrics, finance and microeconomics; literature, swimming and chess.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning actuarial science and quantitative finance.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on finance and microeconomics. Hopefully something realted with pensions. 
- 📫 email: joan.robles@quantil.com.co
- ⚡ Fun fact: I entered my bachelor in economics without a clear idea of what it was about. It turned out being a good fit, but it was pure luck!
